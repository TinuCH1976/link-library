The purpose of this plugin is to add the ability to output a list of link categories and a complete list of links with notes and descriptions.

== Description ==

This plugin is used to be able to create a page on your web site that will contain a list of all of the link categories that you have defined inside of the Links section of the Wordpress administration, along with all links defined in these categories.

The latest version of this plugin has been completely re-vamped to use the filter plugin methods to add contents to the pages. It also contains a configuration page under the admin tools to be able to configure all outputs.

You can see a demonstration of the output of the plugin [here](http://yannickcorner.nayanna.biz/freeware-database/).
