Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 2.8.5
Stable tag: trunk

The purpose of this plugin is to add the ability to output a list of link categories and a complete list of links with notes and descriptions.

== Description ==

** New to version 2.5: The Configuration Panel is now under the Settings section of the Wordpress Admin. **
** Version 2.5 also adds the ability to search through your links and to display results using pagination **

This plugin is used to be able to create a page on your web site that will contain a list of all of the link categories that you have defined inside of the Links section of the Wordpress administration, along with all links defined in these categories. The user can select a sub-set of categories to be displayed or not displayed. Link Library also offers a mode where only one category is shown at a time, using AJAX queries to load other categories based on user input.

For links that carry RSS feed information, Link Library can display a preview of the latest feed items inline with the all links or in a separate preview window.

The latest version of this plugin has been completely re-vamped to use the filter plugin methods to add contents to the pages. It also contains a configuration page under the admin tools to be able to configure all outputs. This page allows for up to five different configurations to be created to display links on different pages of a Wordpress site. The previous API has been restored in version 1.1 for users who just prefer to make calls to PHP functions from their pages.

You can see a few examples of pages using Link Library on my personal site:<br/>
- [Library in table form with search box](http://yannickcorner.nayanna.biz/freeware-database/)<br/>
- [Library in unordered list form with RSS feed icons](http://yannickcorner.nayanna.biz/favorite-links/)<br/>
- [Library in unordered list form with RSS feed icons and Pagination](http://yannickcorner.nayanna.biz/links-page-with-pagination/)<br/>
- [Library only showing one category at a time through AJAX queries](http://yannickcorner.nayanna.biz/freeware-database-ajax-version/)<br/>
- [Library in unordered list form with 1 full RSS item per feed inline and 5 RSS item full previews when selecting preview icon](http://yannickcorner.nayanna.biz/links-page-with-preview/)<br/>

Examples from actual users can be found on my [site](http://yannickcorner.nayanna.biz/wordpress-plugins/).

All pages are generated using different configurations all managed by Link Library. Link Library is compatible with the [My Link Order](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/my-link-order/) plugin to define category and link ordering.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I override some of the options when using shortcodes in my pages =

To override the settings specified inside of the plugin settings page, the two commands can be called with options. Here is the syntax to call these options:

[link-library-cats categorylistoverride="28"]

Overrides the list of categories to be displayed in the category list

[link-library-cats excludecategoryoverride="28"]

Overrides the list of categories to be excluded in the category list

[link-library categorylistoverride="28"]

Overrides the list of categories to be displayed in the link list

[link-library excludecategoryoverride="28"]

Overrides the list of categories to be excluded in the link list

[link-library notesoverride=0]

Set to 0 or 1 to display or not display link notes

[link-library descoverride=0]

Set to 0 or 1 to display or not display link descriptions

[link-library rssoverride=0]

Set to 0 or 1 to display or not display rss information

[link-library tableoverride=0]

Set to 0 or 1 to display links in an unordered list or a table.

= Can Link Library be used as before by calling PHP functions? =

For legacy users of Link Library (pre-1.0), it is still possible to call the back-end functions of the plugin from PHP code to display the contents of your library directly from a page template.

The main differences are that the function names have been changed to reflect the plugin name. However, the parameters are compatible with the previous function, with a few additions having been made. Also, it is important to note that the function does not output the Link Library content by themselves as they did. You now need to print the return value of these functions, which can be simply done with the echo command. Finally, it is possible to call these PHP functions with a single argument ('AdminSettings1', 'AdminSettings2', 'AdminSettings3', 'AdminSettings4' or 'AdminSettings5') so that the settings defined in the Admin section are used.

Here would be the installation procedure:

1. Download the plugin
1. Upload link-library.php to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
1. Activate the plugin in the Wordpress Admin
1. Use the following functions in a [new template](http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Page_Templates) and select this template for your page that should display your Link Library.

`&lt;?php echo LinkLibraryCategories('name', 1, 100, 3, 1, 0, '', '', '', false, '', ''); ?&gt;<br />
`&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;?php echo LinkLibrary('name', 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, '', 0, 0, 1, 1, '&lt;td>', '&lt;/td&gt;', 1, '', '&lt;tr&gt;', '&lt;/tr&gt;', '&lt;td&gt;', '&lt;/td&gt;', 1, '&lt;td&gt;', '&lt;/td&gt;', 1, "Application", "Description", "Similar to", 1, '', '', '', false, 'linklistcatname', false, 0, null, null, null, false, false, false, false, '', ''); ?&gt;
